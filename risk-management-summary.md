# Risk Management Summary

* Poor risk management can be a *major* cause of software failure. **Security/safety** concerns get ignored, some risks are underestimated.

* What is a risk - uncertain factors result in loss of satisfaction due to a desired occurrence not happening, with *undesired* occurrences happening. E.g., train door not opening at stop or opening when train is moving.

* risk trees organize failures, causes and consequences along casual links. Can be a useful way to visualize all risks.
