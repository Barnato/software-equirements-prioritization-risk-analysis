by Boehm

Review pdf [here](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sherriff/papers/Boehm%20-%201991.pdf)

* Reduce negative impact on software operation and prevent operation rework
* Project disasters

## Methods for identifying risk

* Decision tree - example - controlling a space craft
* Options, outcomes (and risk exposure of those outcomes) and probability

_Top ten software risk items_

* Risk information checklists
* personal shortcuts
* unrealistic budgets and schedules
* developing the wrong software functions
* developing the wrong user interface
* gold plating
* continuing stream of requirements
* shortfalls in external components
* Shortfalls in externally performed tasks
* Real time performance shortfalls
* Straining computer science capabilities

Example:

  * Risk analysis and prioritization - Risk exposure quantity and for prioritization cost/benefit analysis is often performed
  * risk resolution - can includes simulation and prototyping

* focus on critical success factors, projects fail because of focus on wrong thing - boiler plate documents, exploring peripheral but intriguing technical issues, and playing politics
