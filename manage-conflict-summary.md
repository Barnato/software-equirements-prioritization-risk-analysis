# Manage Conflict Summary

* Managing conflicts by focusing on the following issues in a requirements document:
  * overlapping statements.
  * multiple words that mean the same thing.
  * terms and definitions.

* Informal and formal methods should be used. Informally - can the overlapping statements be compatible and under what circumstances they are not. With large number of requirements formal methods with automation and assurance might be good.

* Elicitation techniques can be used to solve conflict.
* Don't need to address conflicts immediately, gather info first. Don't leave to the end of the project. It is a balance.
* Clarify statements with target/source. Who is doing what in the process.
* Weaken conflicting statements (more likely with low priority statements).
* Conflicting and non conflicting statement: Si,j = 0; Si,j = 1.
* evaluation criteria for preferred resolution is solving other conflicts/risks.
