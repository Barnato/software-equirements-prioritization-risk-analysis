# Risk Management

Iterative

* Poor risk management major cause of software development failure

* Security & safety get ignored

* unrecognized or unestimated risk - lead to inadequate requirements

* risk: example - a passenger can force train doors open when train is moving

* risk - likelihood of bad consequence and severity 

* passenger could fall out of train 

* risk, consuqnece likelihood

* severity - degree of loss of satisifaction, passenger falling out of train, high severity 

* non functional risks - product cannot provide security

* process related risks - cost overuns, decline of product morale, high turnover, product is not developed

* list of questions to spot product risks:

* component inspection

* review every component, human, devices, and software component

* ask if the component can fail, how, and why?

* Can install backup systems, station controller, door controller, track sensors 

* example: doors controller could fail, in what situations could this occur

* example: inaccuracy of speed of train, location....collision...
