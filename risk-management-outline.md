# Risk Management Outline

* **Analytic Hierarchy Process**
    * calculate relative cost/value of a requirement's contribution to a project
    *  compare requirements pairwise
    * Consists of *2* steps
    * scale contributions between requirements
    * scalability when prioritizing requirements - discuss subset with small group of stakeholders but remember that stakeholders do not want to go through everything.

* A risk consequence table is an example of an impact matrix

* *Nasa Defect Detection Program* - elaborate effectiveness of countermeasures
